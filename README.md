A custom PHP CMS system for a blog website that I've created on my learning path. For the views I've used both blog and admin panel's templates from start bootstrap website. This CMS system could be improved in a lot of ways, but it's just for the learning purposes. *Website uses pretty urls which are described in the .htaccess file. User's status can be changed in the admin panel's profile section.
